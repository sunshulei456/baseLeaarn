Spring’s flexible and comprehensive set of extensions and third-party libraries let developers build almost any application imaginable. At its core, Spring Framework’s Inversion of Control (IoC) and Dependency Injection (DI) features provide the foundation for a wide-ranging set of features and functionality. Whether you’re building secure, reactive, cloud-based microservices for the web, or complex streaming data flows for the enterprise, Spring has the tools to help.

Spring Boot transforms how you approach Java programming tasks, radically streamlining your experience. Spring Boot combines necessities such as an application context and an auto-configured, embedded web server to make microservice development a cinch. To go even faster, you can combine Spring Boot with Spring Cloud’s rich set of supporting libraries, servers, patterns, and templates, to safely deploy entire microservices-based architectures into the cloud, in record time.

Our engineers care deeply about performance. With Spring, you’ll notice fast startup, fast shutdown, and optimized execution, by default. Increasingly, Spring projects also support the reactive (nonblocking) programming model for even greater efficiency. Developer productivity is Spring’s superpower. Spring Boot helps developers build applications with ease and with far less toil than other competing paradigms. Embedded web servers, auto-configuration, and “fat jars” help you get started quickly, and innovations like LiveReload in Spring DevTools mean developers can iterate faster than ever before. You can even start a new Spring project in seconds, with the Spring Initializr at start.spring.io.

Spring has a proven track record of dealing with security issues quickly and responsibly. The Spring committers work with security professionals to patch and test any reported vulnerabilities. Third-party dependencies are also monitored closely, and regular updates are issued to help keep your data and applications as safe as possible. In addition, Spring Security makes it easier for you to integrate with industry-standard security schemes and deliver trustworthy solutions that are secure by default.

The Spring community is enormous, global, diverse, and spans folks of all ages and capabilities, from complete beginners to seasoned pros. No matter where you are on your journey, you can find the support and resources you need to get you to the next level: quickstarts, videos, meetups, support, or even formal training and certification.
